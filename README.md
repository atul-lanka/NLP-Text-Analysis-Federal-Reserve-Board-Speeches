# NLP-Text-Analysis-Federal-Reserve-Board-Speeches
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze Federal Reserve (Fed) Speeches:

- Categorize the Federal Reserve Chairman’s speeches into categories or topics of interest 
- Identify trends in topics that each Chairman has uniquely discussed in their term
- Identify the numerous agencies they've created or supported in order to implement their policies
- Compare quantitative measures and clusters against key economic indicators such as Fed Funds Rate and Unemployment as well as historic events that have impacted our economy in the last two decades (2000 dot com bubble, 9/11, 2008 Housing Crisis, 2020 Covid-19 pandemic)  to determine whether there is any palpable correlation.
- Use sentiment analysis to compare tone and impartiality for each Chair’s addresses over their respective terms.
